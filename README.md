                                DAILY SCHEDULER

STORY:

Hello user my name is Chris Garcia. I am a full time student and have a million things happening everyday. With having so much to do I created a daily scheduler so that I dont forget to do any thing during the day. After getting it running i figured id make it public so that someone else could take advantage of my free scheduler. Hope you enjoy.

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.

Near the top of the calendar, the application should display the current day. Additionally, each hour should be color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.



This is the website to my planner.
